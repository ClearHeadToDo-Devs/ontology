    rdfs:comment """A minimal extension to the Common Core Ontologies (CCO) for tracking action commitments.

This ontology follows a disciplined approach: reference CCO classes directly rather than wrapping them.
We add only what CCO lacks - specifically, lifecycle phase tracking for planned acts.

Core CCO classes used (by reference):
- Plan (ont00000974): Action definitions / task templates
- Planned Act (ont00000228): Action instances / executions
- Objective (ont00000476): Projects / desired outcomes

Custom extension:
- ActPhase: Lifecycle states (NotStarted, InProgress, Completed, Blocked, Cancelled)
- hasPhase: Links a Planned Act to its current phase
- hasObjective: Links a Plan to the Objective it serves

For full CCO definitions, see: https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies"""@en ;
